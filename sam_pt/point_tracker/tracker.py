    Abstract class for point trackers.

    Methods
    -------
    forward(rgbs, query_points)
        Performs a forward pass through the model and returns the predicted trajectories and visibilities.
    evaluate_batch(rgbs, query_points, trajectories_gt=None, visibilities_gt=None)
        Evaluates a batch of videos and returns the results.
    unpack_results(packed_results, batch_idx)
        Unpacks the results for all point and all videos in the batch.

        Performs a forward pass through the model and returns the predicted trajectories and visibilities.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rgbs : torch.Tensor
            A tensor of shape (batch_size, n_frames, channels, height, width)
            containing the RGB images in uint8 [0-255] format.
        query_points : torch.Tensor
            A tensor of shape (batch_size, n_points, 3) containing the query points,
            each point being (t, x, y).

        Returns
        -------
        tuple of two torch.Tensor
            Returns a tuple of (trajectories, visibilities).
            - `trajectories`: Predicted point trajectories with shape (batch_size, n_frames, n_points, 2), where each
                              trajectory represents a series of (x, y) coordinates in the video for a specific point.
            - `visibilities`: Predicted point visibilities with shape (batch_size, n_frames, n_points), where each
                              visibility represents the likelihood of a point being visible in the corresponding frame
                              of the video.
